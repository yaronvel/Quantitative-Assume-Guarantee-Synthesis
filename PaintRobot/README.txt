This folder include the specification from in Listing 1.1 and its modified versions 
used for Table 1 to illustrate different GR(1)[F] semantics.

The reductions for Table 1 were done manually. All four specifications are included 
with the maximal T. The parameters to do synthesis for different value T can be 
found at the bottom of each specification. 

The different semantics are described in the file names, e.g., file
PaintJobRobot_TRANS_implication_average.spectra contains the GR(1)[F]
synthesis problem with disjunctive implication, average over assumptions, 
and average over guarantees. Each specification file starts with a comment repeating
the semantics.
